            <h1>Social media privacy</h1>
            <p></p>
            <h2>Background Information on Social media</h2>
            <p>Over the past two decades, social media platforms have become vast and powerful tools for connecting, communicating, sharing content, conducting business, and disseminating news and information. Today, millions or billions of users populate major social networks including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. 
               But the extraordinary growth of social media has given platforms extraordinary access and influence into the lives of users. Social networking companies harvest sensitive data about individual activities, interests, personal characteristics, political views, purchasing habits, and online behaviors. In many cases this data is used to algorithmically drive user engagement and to sell behavioral advertising—often with distortive and discriminatory impacts. </p>
            <h2>Privacy before social media.</h2>
            <p> Our attitude and approach toward online consumer privacy have changed since the early days of the internet. Over time, we’ve realized not every online entity has our best interests at heart; even seemingly innocuous websites can pose a security risk by not adequately protecting our personal information. Today, the evolution of privacy continues to shift as consumers grow savvier and technology becomes dramatically more pervasive in our lives.A few years ago, the online privacy concerns of most consumers were just beginning to take shape, with the recognition that a surprisingly large number of reputable companies were doing a shockingly poor job of securing consumers’ personal data in their data centers.

                 Massive hacks, seemingly one right after another, impacted even the most novice internet users, from companies like Yahoo, Target and Marriott. What's particularly problematic is that many of these hacks were reported months, if not years, after the breaches, leaving customers feeling helpless and misled.

                 At the same time, spyware became a popular way for cybercriminals to steal credit card information, banking credentials and identities, leaving the consumer vulnerable, while regulatory agencies struggled to keep up with the fast pace of fraudulent activity.
                
                 Another issue stemmed from consumer click data, harvested to build comprehensive profiles of individual interests based on websites you visit, in what order, what pages you click through, how long you stay and what you look at while you are there. Even tried-and-true protective measures, such as clearing your browser’s cookies, became ineffective as “supercookies” and more insidious techniques took over.</p>
            <h3>How was privacy viewed and protected before the onset of Social media?</h3>
            <p>Before the advent of social media, and the internet, privacy was much easier to protect due to the increased hardship in accessing private information. Before the introduction of social media, private information usually resided in more physical things, such as paper records, that required more difficulty to uncover. Back then, privacy was entirely dependent on how much information someone chose to share, as long as an individual did not share personal details, their private information could be undisturbed for the most part. 
                However, back then, the most common concerns for privacy were basic details like home addresses, phone numbers, and workplaces. These were typically found through phone directories, public record, or word of mouth - make it more difficult for hackers to get more sensitive information such as passwords or bank account details, which usually resided in physical forms rather than digital appliances. 
                In terms of privacy protection, privacy was protected by a slower pace of life and communication. Most interactions would be personal or over the phone whilst the exchange of personal information happened in more controlled and private settings. Without the widespread use of social platforms, emails etc, there were fewer opportunities  for unknown people to find personal details. For anyone to get access to personal information, which was usually in physical mail, they would have to resort to traditional methods like theft or manipulation, which are far more noticeable and lack efficiency. 
                Furthermore, there were fewer ways for individuals to be tracked or monitored. Without the constant connectivity of smartphones, online searches and location-based services, it was much harder for anyone to keep tabs on daily routines or preferences. For the most part, daily activities, interests and vulnerable information was only known by people who were seen on a regular basis, making privacy much easier to preserve.
                Overall, privacy before the introduction of social media was a matter of control - people had more direct oversight over their personal information with minimal chances of unknown people getting access to vulnerable information. As long as one kept their physical boundaries and avoided disclosing sensitive details, their private life would have almost no chances of hindrance. </p>
            <h4>How has social media affected our privacy today?</h4>
            <p>In the recent years, the expansion of social media has certainly revolutionized the way we commute and use technology to a new level that has not been witnessed before. While social media platforms offer enjoyment, entertainment and self-expression, they also raise serious concerns on privacy. With every post, like or share, users continuously generate vast amounts of data. This data is tracked, collected and analyses by social media companies, which has sparked widespread unease over critical issues such as surveillance capitalism - the practice of earning money by sharing personal information without the consent of users.
                Unlike the past, where the sharing of personal information was more deliberate and controlled by an individual, today’s social media apps collect sensitive data as users simply navigate their platforms. Even the act of signing up for an account often involves sharing highly sensitive details such as one's address, phone number, and email. Though these details are often used to find the best content for an individual and enhancing  the overall user experience, the potential for misuse is extremely alarming. If this data were to fall into the wrong hands—whether through hacking, data breaches, or third-party practices—it could lead to identity theft, fraud, or even personal threats.
                Furthermore, the sheer scale of data collection on social media platforms makes it increasingly difficult for users to maintain control over their own information. While privacy policies are often long and complex, the vast majority of users may not fully understand the extent of the data being collected, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. As social media continues to expand, it is clear that the way we interact with social media has significantly shifted from the past, with privacy concerns taking center stage as one of the most pressing issues of the digital age. </p>
