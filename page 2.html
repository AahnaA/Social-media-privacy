      <h1>How does social media operate?</h1>
      <img src="Facebook.png"Social Media" class="content-image"> 
    <p>Every social media platform comprises a mix of users with different preferences. Without a filtering system, users must navigate through a flood of posts, which can be overwhelming.

      As a result, social media platforms have established algorithms, that are defined as series of instructions designed to solve specific problems, perform tasks or make decisions. In the context of social media, platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat and any other social media warehouse for that matter, have distinct algorithms that ¬†determine how content is filtered, ranked, selected and recommended to users.
      
      For instance, when you access a social media platform, you may notice that the app provides you with videos, reels or stories that relate to a video of a similar context that you may have viewed in the past. That is the work of algorithms. 
      
      The primary reason why social media companies apply algorithms relates to the sorting and matching of content to audiences with similar preferences. This not only enhances the overall user experience by providing them content that they are interested in, but also personalizes user experience whilst boosting social media presence by recommending your content to millions around the world.
      
      In short, Algorithms are the heart of the Social media that our public loves and enjoys today. However, these algorithms have also become the catalyst for high controversy and concerns over privacy in the recent times.</p>

  <h3>What are the privacy issues with social media algorithms?</h3>
    <p>As previously discussed, Algorithms are what form the basis of social media by filtering, sorting and recommending content. However, in order for an Algorithm to function, it needs access to one‚Äôs sensitive private information as a basis to make the best decisions of content to recommend to them.
    You may notice, that when you first install social media, the platform will provide you with a questionnaire that will ask for your email address/phone number, city, age, name etc. That‚Äôs right - all of this information that is collected is straightaway taken in by the algorithm to provide the best content for you. Here are the factors which have sparked the questioning of social media privacy:</p>
  <h3>‚û°Ô∏èUnawareness of what the data is being used for</h3>
  <p class="paragraph-privacy"></p>
    <p>However, the collection of this information has left users feeling stranded about their privacy rights and sensitive information. One of the biggest concerns of individuals is the unawareness of what their data is being used for. While signing up to an app, the users often agree to the terms and conditions, however, these documents are long, complex and written in legal jargon, often leaving users perplexed when they try to comprehend this document. As a result, users are often unaware of where their data is being collected and used to record things like their browsing history, liked items etc, without their full consent. As a result, the process to obtain consent is often misleading and makes it difficult for users to know where their data is actually headed and what is being done with it.</p>
  <h3>‚û°Ô∏èSharing of data across individuals or companies.</h3>
  <p class="paragraph-privacy"></p>
   <p> Once collected, user data can be used in ways that users may not approve of or anticipate. For example, advertisers can leverage detailed user profiles to target individuals of the same demographic with personalized ads. These ads may not be a generic topic, but can also be inappropriate, hurtful and disturbing for certain users. Furthermore, the data a platform contains is not solely for themselves - but is also given to third-party companies who use it to reach out to you to advertise, promote or even threaten. In addition, if a social media company acquires or merges with another, for instance, the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook ‚Äì the data is further shared across the two companies, handing over the data to a new entity, sharing user data across places, where it can be further misused or shared. Giving their data to many unknown companies can be uncomfortable, unprofessional and disturbing for users, severely interrupting their privacy and data consents.</p>
  <h3>‚û°Ô∏èCybersafety concerns</h3>
  <p class="paragraph-privacy"></p>
    <p>Another common issue is the one of cybersecurity and cybersafety. The more data that is collected, the more attractive it becomes to malicious actors. Social media platforms have been frequent targets for Cyberattacks, and data breaches can lead to the exposure of sensitive personal information. For instance, if a hacker gains access to a social media database, they could steal email addresses, phone numbers, and even private messages. This puts users at risk of identity theft, phishing attacks, or even financial loss. Despite the security measures that companies claim to have in place, high-profile data breaches continue to happen, shaking public confidence in the ability of platforms to protect personal data.</p>
